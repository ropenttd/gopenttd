// admin provides a fairly low-level interface to the Admin port of an OpenTTD game server.
// This library mostly provides access to packet marshalling and unmarshalling into structs -
// it's up to you to work with the packet data.
// You probably want to use this library if you're making bots, or just want raw access to the packet data.
